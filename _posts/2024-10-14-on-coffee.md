I have been getting into coffee recently. Thought I'd write up a list(and some very opinionated comments) of interesting coffee/tea shops I have visited so far in NYC.

Some are inspirational, others are memorable(or *bleh*), but here's a first cut at documenting it.

- **[Super Nice Coffee, 7th Ave, NYC](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vnC6WEoMScSuHXKA6)**

    This coffee shop location is *super* interesting, since the location is not just a coffee shop. Rather, a coffee shop, a flower shop and an omakase all share the same location! The coffee and flower shops are open in the morning, and the omakase opens at night.

    Shoutout to Riley and Ari for going along with my coffee shenanigans here(especially wrt helping me figure out the ideal grind size for my Aeropress, and the proper ratio of chicory syrup to add in order to recreate the taste of South Indian Filter Coffee), and for Sameer to stand by absolutely disgusted with the taste of espresso. 

- **[Sey Coffee, BK, NYC](https://www.seycoffee.com)**

    This place jumpstarted my journey on speciality coffee. It is a must visit. 

    Also I took a picture(it's an Aeropress brew, because yours truly went there *15 minutes before the shop closed*. It was still really fruity. I'd describe the outcome as caffienated happiness.)

- **[La Cabra, SoHo, NYC](https://us.lacabra.com/pages/soho)**

    La Cabra has some super aromatic beans. Ironically, I stumbled upon the shop on Lafayette for 2 reasons:

    * I would go on a walk every afternoon to clear my head. Lafayette and Houston is a block away from the Qualcomm office. 
    * Sant Ambroeus down the street has very good gelato, but I wanted something warm that afternoon(!) 

    Honestly very nice. I bought a box of the Ethiopian Chelchele.

- **[Do Not Feed Alligators, Bleecker St, NYC](https://donotfeedalligators.com/)**

    The variety here is really good. I also found it to be very chic, situated in the part of Bleecket St which is to the west of 6th ave. I think I had a pour over from Nomad, but I don't remember my order that well. 

    I really liked the location of this shop.

    There is a small courtyard inside. I was drinking coffee with Henry there.

- **[Qahwah House, W Village, NYC](https://www.qahwahhouse.com/)**

    This Yemeni coffee place makes such good tea, that I went here not *once*, not *twice*, but *thrice* (in 3 days). Also, what helped me was the fact that it was 3-ish blocks away from my office on Bleecker and Broadway. 

    The Yemeni tea is amazing. It somehow tends to get sweeter towards the end, and gives you a mild sugar rush(which I'm a fan of). The honey bread also paired really well with this.

- **[Hidden Grounds, BK, NYC](https://thehiddengrounds.com/)**

    A very interesting Indian themed coffee/chai shop I found in Brooklyn when biking with Henry to Williamsburg on the citi bike. Served as a nice pit stop, gulab jamun donut is an interesting take.  

    Also, the only pic I have is that of the entrance `:(`
